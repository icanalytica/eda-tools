# macportseda

A local [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) port tree for EDA tools.  Tested on MacOS 13. (I tried the new MacOS and they used more power and did less)
This work is motivated by the fact that my needs that generally don't overlap with most communities.  
I always felt bad contributing to macports because I'm not a very good at software engineering, and the lack of experience made me a bad collaborator.  I'm still poor at GIT.

Ports live under a category directory (`cad`) as MacPorts expects.

## Using this tree

1. Register the tree in `sources.conf`. Put the local `file://` line *above*
   the rsync line so local ports take precedence:

   ```
   sudo $EDITOR $(port dir macports-base >/dev/null 2>&1; echo)/opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf
   ```

   (Usually `/opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf`.) Add:

   ```
   file:///Users/degs/private/projects/software/macportseda
   rsync://rsync.macports.org/macports/release/tarballs/ports.tar [default]
   ```

2. Build the port index (run inside this directory):

   ```
   cd /Users/degs/private/projects/software/macportseda
   portindex
   ```

3. Install. Each port is `sudo port install <name>`. Quick reference:

   | Port | Command | Notes |
   |------|---------|-------|
   | OpenSTA | `sudo port install OpenSTA` | `+cudd` default; `+basic` for no CUDD; `+readline`. Pulls `cudd`. |
   | klayout | `sudo port install klayout` | Qt6 GUI (native Cocoa, no XQuartz). Long build. |
   | netgen-lvs | `sudo port install netgen-lvs` | LVS; *not* `netgen` (that's a FEM mesher). X11 GUI → XQuartz. |
   | openvaf | `sudo port install openvaf` | Verilog-A→OSDI; binary is `openvaf-r`. |
   | gtkwave / xcircuit / iverilog / magic | `sudo port install <name>` | Vendored stock snapshots. `magic`/`xcircuit` are X11 → XQuartz. |
   | xschem | `sudo port install xschem` | Schematic capture. **X11 → needs XQuartz** (see notes). |
   | xyce | `sudo port install xyce` | Parallel SPICE; pulls `trilinos16`. |
   | py-volare | `sudo port install py-volare` | PDK manager; py313, installs `volare`. |
   | skim-app | `sudo port install skim-app` | Skim PDF/EPS reader → `/Applications/MacPorts`. |
   | kicad | see below ⚠️ | Full EDA suite + libraries. **Needs `boost` deactivated to build.** |
   | trilinos-charon / charon | see below ⚠️ | TCAD; **need `trilinos16` deactivated to build.** |

   Installing `OpenSTA` pulls in the local `cudd` port automatically.

   **Build-time deactivation gotchas** (MacPorts can't do these automatically —
   the build *fails* without them):

   - **kicad** conflicts with the umbrella `boost` port during the build:
     ```
     sudo port -f deactivate boost
     sudo port install kicad            # long build; pulls symbols/footprints/3D/templates
     sudo port activate boost
     ```
   - **charon** and **trilinos-charon** are shadowed by `trilinos16`'s stub
     `mpi.h` during the build:
     ```
     sudo port -f deactivate trilinos16
     sudo port install charon           # or trilinos-charon
     sudo port activate trilinos16       # rev-upgrade usually re-activates it anyway
     ```

   GUI tools that use X11 (`xschem`, `magic`, `netgen-lvs`, `xcircuit`) need a
   running X server — install **XQuartz** (see the xschem notes). `klayout`
   (Qt6) and `skim-app` are native Cocoa and don't.

## OpenSTA notes

- Upstream (`parallaxsw/OpenSTA`) publishes no git tags or releases, so the
  Portfile pins a specific `master` commit. The `version` is the `project()`
  version from `CMakeLists.txt` at that commit. To update: change the commit
  and version in the Portfile, then run `port -v checksum OpenSTA` and paste the
  reported values into the `checksums` block.
- CUDD support is on by default via the `+cudd` variant, satisfied by the
  sibling `cudd` port. `+cudd` and `+basic` are mutually exclusive; requesting
  `+basic` overrides the default and builds without CUDD (losing some BDD-based
  optimizations).
- OpenSTA's bundled `FindTCL.cmake` hard-codes Homebrew paths on macOS, so the
  Portfile passes `-DTCL_LIB_PATHS=${prefix}/lib`; without it the build cannot
  find the MacPorts Tcl.
- `tclreadline` (interactive line editing) is in MacPorts (`devel/tclreadline`)
  and off by default. Enable with `+readline`. It is forced off otherwise so the
  build does not silently link an already-installed tclreadline without
  declaring the dependency.

## cudd notes

- Built from the `cuddorg/cudd` `3.0.0` release tag (the version OpenSTA
  recommends). It installs `cudd.h` into `${prefix}/include` and `libcudd` into
  `${prefix}/lib`, which is where OpenSTA's `FindCUDD.cmake` looks given
  `-DCUDD_DIR=${prefix}`.
- This port is not yet known to MacPorts until the tree is registered and
  `portindex` has run; until then `port lint OpenSTA` reports
  `Unknown dependency: cudd`, which is expected and resolves after indexing.

## netgen-lvs notes

- Tim Edwards' netgen (LVS), built from the `RTimothyEdwards/netgen` `1.5.321`
  tag. Named `netgen-lvs` to avoid colliding with MacPorts' unrelated
  `math/netgen` (a FEM mesh generator) — `port install netgen-lvs`.
- Needs `tk-x11`: netgen's Tcl build refuses to compile without X11, so the X11
  Tk is pulled in even though batch LVS opens no window.
- The build uses the `tcllibrary` / `install-tcl-real` make targets directly
  because netgen's default targets pipe through `make.log`/`install.log`, which
  hide output and can mask failures by always exiting 0.

## klayout notes

- KLayout (`KLayout/klayout` tag `v0.30.9`), Qt6 GUI with Ruby + Python
  scripting. Long build (~100 MB source + full Qt link).
- Uses a bespoke `build.sh` (qmake-based) that builds and installs every
  artefact into one self-contained directory. The Portfile drives the phases by
  hand: `build.sh` stages into `${workpath}` with the final RPATH
  (`${prefix}/lib/klayout`) baked in, and destroot copies the tree into
  `${prefix}/lib/klayout`, symlinking the tools (`klayout`, `strm*`) into
  `${prefix}/bin`.
- The libgit2-based package manager is disabled (`-nolibgit2`) to keep the
  external-library surface small; it is irrelevant to layout/DRC.

## py-volare notes (PDK version manager)

- `py-volare` is a Python package; it pulls in two helper ports that were also
  missing from MacPorts: `py-pcpp` (pure Python) and `py-zstandard` (builds a C
  extension against its own bundled zstd, no external dependency). All three
  build 311/312/313 subports and default to Python 3.13.
- The `volare` executable is installed as `volare-3.13`; the default-version
  subport also symlinks an unsuffixed `volare` into `${prefix}/bin`.
- Largely redundant if you already have your PDKs installed; useful for pinning
  PDK versions or fetching new builds.

## openvaf notes (Verilog-A compiler)

- **OpenVAF-Reloaded** — the maintained community continuation of OpenVAF (the
  original by Pascal Kuthe has been unmaintained since end of 2023). Compiles
  Verilog-A compact device models to OSDI shared libraries for ngspice / Xyce.
  Rust + LLVM.
- **Status: working.** `openvaf-r model.va` compiles a Verilog-A model to a
  `model.osdi` Mach-O shared library (verified on a resistor and a diode model).
- Built with the `cargo` PortGroup. The full crates.io dependency set (147
  crates) is pinned inline from upstream's `Cargo.lock`; one extra dependency
  (`salsa`) is an unpublished git fork (`pascalkuthe/salsa`), pulled via
  `cargo.crates_github` (a `post-extract` exposes its `salsa-macros` member as
  its own directory-source entry and drops the PortGroup's stray `branch` line).
- **Pinned to a mob-branch commit, not the tag.** The only tag (`v24.0.0mob`)
  has 2022-era codegen that **segfaults** emitting OSDI metadata on LLVM 18;
  mob HEAD fixed it, so the Portfile pins commit `dafc73c` (2026-06-24).
- **LLVM:** the fork supports LLVM 18-21 selected by a cargo feature. The
  Portfile uses MacPorts `llvm-18` (`--features llvm18`,
  `LLVM_SYS_181_PREFIX=${prefix}/libexec/llvm-18`) and forces **static** LLVM
  linking (flips llvm-sys `prefer-dynamic`→`force-static`), so `openvaf-r` is
  self-contained. To switch LLVM major, change `--features llvmNN` and
  `LLVM_SYS_NN1_PREFIX` together.
- Builds only the CLI driver; the installed binary is **`openvaf-r`** (upstream's
  name). `external/vacask` is a test-only git submodule, not needed to build.

## yosys notes (Verilog synthesis)

- Yosys 0.66, the open Verilog RTL synthesis suite (the synthesis front-end of
  the digital flow). Built from the official **`yosys-src.tar.gz`** release
  tarball, which **bundles ABC** and carries `.gitcommit` — so no network fetch
  or git is needed during the build (installs `yosys` + `yosys-abc`).
- Makefile build (`use_configure no`): `make CONFIG=clang PREFIX=${prefix}`.
  Yosys's Makefile **auto-detects MacPorts** (adds `${prefix}` include/lib/
  pkgconfig when `port` is on PATH), so deps resolve cleanly:
  bison/flex/pkgconfig (build) + tcl/readline/libtommath/zlib (lib).
- The release tarball is *flat* (no top directory), hence `extract.mkdir yes`.
- Verified: synthesizes RTL to gates and runs ABC technology mapping.
- This is the synthesis half only; the digital P&R side (OpenROAD) is not
  packaged (heavy Bazel/OR-Tools dependency cascade, and not needed for the
  analog-focused flow).

## skim-app notes (Skim PDF/EPS reader)

- Skim, the macOS PDF/PostScript reader/annotator, for viewing EPS plots from
  the EDA tools. Named **`skim-app`** to avoid the unrelated MacPorts `skim`
  (a Rust fuzzy finder) — `port install skim-app`.
- Installs the **official prebuilt universal app** (no source build): the port
  fetches `Skim-<ver>.dmg`, and `destroot` mounts it with `hdiutil` (via
  `system`) and `ditto`s `Skim.app` into `/Applications/MacPorts/`.
- EPS: Skim registers `com.adobe.encapsulated-postscript` and opens EPS/PS via
  macOS's built-in PostScript importer (present on Ventura). If an EPS won't
  render on a newer macOS, convert first with ghostscript (`epstopdf`); see the
  port's `notes`.

## kicad notes (KiCad 10.0.4)

- Adapted from the stock MacPorts `kicad` port (which is stuck at 7.0.11) to
  **10.0.4**, Unix-style: real binaries in `/opt/local/bin` plus `.app`
  launchers in `/Applications/MacPorts/KiCad/`. Builds, runs, rev-upgrade clean.
- The fight to get it building on Ventura (all in the Portfile / `files/`):
  - Re-ported the `KICAD_MACOSX_APP_BUNDLE=OFF` patch across 3 major versions
    (pcbnew CMake restructure, `paths.cpp` guard split, `kicad-cli` install).
  - New v10 deps: `zstd`, `libgit2`, `fontconfig`, `protobuf3-cpp`, `nng`,
    `gnutar`. `conflicts_build boost` ⇒ deactivate `boost` for the build
    (`sudo port -f deactivate boost`, reactivate after).
  - **C++23 stdlib:** KiCad 10 uses `std::ranges::views::values` etc. that the
    Ventura SDK libc++ (15) lacks, so it builds with **`macports-clang-19` + its
    libc++ 19 headers** (system libc++ runtime).
  - wxWidgets 3.3→3.2 API fallback, an mbedtls link fix for the static
    `libnng.a`, GNU-tar for the bitmap archive, and a klayout-style
    install-name rewrite (`files/fix-install-names.sh`) so the `.kiface`/3D
    plugins resolve the kicad libs.
- **Data libraries** (`kicad-symbols`/`-footprints`/`-packages3D`/`-templates`)
  are subports installed from GitLab 10.0.4 archives. The `kicad-docs` subport
  was **dropped**: CERN's prebuilt docs tarballs stop at 8.0.0-rc3, so there is
  no `kicad-doc-10.0.4`; KiCad's Help menu uses the online docs instead.
- See [[kicad-port-facts]] in memory for the full blow-by-blow.

## vendored stock ports (gtkwave, xcircuit, iverilog, magic)

- These four are **verbatim snapshots of the stock MacPorts ports** (Portfile +
  any `files/` patches), copied in so this tree is a self-contained EDA catalog.
  They are not modified; they simply shadow the stock ports because the local
  `file://` source sits above the rsync line in `sources.conf`.
- This is a deliberate **snapshot/pin**, not a fork to maintain. Since I'm the
  sole user, I'd rather freeze a known-good revision than chase upstream — these
  intentionally won't pick up MacPorts version bumps until re-copied.
- To refresh one to the current upstream revision, re-copy it, e.g.:
  ```
  cp -R /opt/local/var/macports/sources/rsync.macports.org/macports/release/tarballs/ports/science/magic/. \
        science/magic/ && portindex
  ```
- `gtkwave` has historically been finicky to build here, which is exactly why
  pinning a working revision in-tree is worthwhile.
- `ngspice` is deliberately **left on stock MacPorts** (not vendored).

## xschem notes

- Schematic capture (3.4.6). Builds against the X11 Tk (`tk +x11`).
- **X server required.** macOS ships none, and the MacPorts `xorg-server` is
  deprecated/broken on Ventura and later — with it installed, xschem fails with
  "can't open display". Fix: `sudo port -f uninstall xorg-server
  xorg-server-devel`, install the official **XQuartz** from
  <https://www.xquartz.org>, then log out/in so `$DISPLAY` registers. The port's
  `notes` (shown on install, or via `port notes xschem`) spells this out.
- The same X server requirement applies to the other X11 GUIs here
  (`magic`, `netgen-lvs`, the `klayout` GUI).

## trilinos16 / xyce notes

- Migrated from a separate local tree. `trilinos16` is the *serial* Trilinos
  subset Xyce needs (Epetra/Teuchos/AztecOO/...); `xyce` (7.9) links it.
- Both build C/C++ with Apple clang and Fortran with gcc13; they install into
  `${prefix}` normally. Xyce upstream only rigorously tests Trilinos 14.4, so
  these versions are pinned deliberately — bumping Trilinos is risky.

## trilinos-charon notes

- A *second*, independent Trilinos build configured with **MPI + the full Panzer
  stack** (Tpetra, Panzer, Phalanx, Intrepid2, STK, SEACAS, MueLu, ...), needed
  by Charon. Built with `openmpi-gcc13` and gcc's native `libstdc++`.
- Installs into a **private prefix** `${prefix}/libexec/trilinos-charon` so it
  coexists with the serial `trilinos16` (no shared `lib/cmake/Trilinos` or
  library-name collisions).
- Build requires the full gcc13/2024-toolchain fix set (see the Portfile):
  `libstdc++`, `-Wl,-no_warn_duplicate_libraries`, `-include cstdint`,
  `-DNETCDF_ENABLE_LEGACY_MACROS`, `-DBOOST_STACKTRACE_GNU_SOURCE_NOT_REQUIRED`,
  `-fpermissive`, serial-HDF5 bypass, and STK subpackage trims.

## charon notes (Sandia TCAD)

- Charon v2.2 is a TriBITS *project* that builds Trilinos (as an extra
  repository) **from source alongside itself** — it does not link an installed
  Trilinos. The Portfile fetches two distfiles (Charon + vanilla Trilinos 13.4)
  and drops the Trilinos source at `tcad-charon/Trilinos` where Charon expects
  it. Installs to the private prefix `${prefix}/libexec/charon`.
- Charon-specific build notes: BoostLib needs non-`-mt` symlinks (MacPorts boost
  is `-mt`-suffixed); `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` (TriBITS rejects the portgroup's
  `MacPorts` type); HDF5 re-enabled after `General.opts` (MacPorts netCDF is
  netCDF-4, so Exodus needs `libhdf5`); Percept disabled (broken vanilla
  `CMakeLists`).
- The solver binary is `charon_mp.exe`; a `post-activate` hook symlinks it to
  `${prefix}/bin/charon` (with a `pre-deactivate` cleanup).
- **Build-time caveat:** `trilinos16`'s serial stub `${prefix}/include/mpi.h`
  shadows openmpi's real header during the compile, so `trilinos16` must be
  deactivated for the build: `sudo port -f deactivate trilinos16` before, and
  `sudo port activate trilinos16` after (rev-upgrade reactivates it anyway).
  The same applies to building `trilinos-charon`.
